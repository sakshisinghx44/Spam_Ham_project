# Spam vs Ham Classification using Average Word2Vec

This project is a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Average Word2Vec embeddings**. The project is implemented in Python using libraries like `gensim`, `scikit-learn`, and `pandas`.

---

## **Project Overview**
- SMS spam classification is a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) problem.
- The dataset contains labeled messages as `spam` or `ham`.
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.) is applied.
- **Word2Vec embeddings** are used to convert text into numeric vectors.
- A classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM) is trained to predict message categories.

## **Key Features**
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords.
- Vectorization using **Average Word2Vec** (instead of bag-of-words).
- Trained on classical ML models.
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `gensim`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
